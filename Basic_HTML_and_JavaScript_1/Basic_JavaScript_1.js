alert("hey there, pal. friend. buddy. we're buddies, right? just wanted to see what my ol' pal was up to. browsing the web, eh? not surprising. it's the thing to be doing, these days. done plenty of browsing myself, of course. something of an expert, some have said. I wouldn't say that, but some have. can't blame em, of course. I mean, I'm good at it. sure. I'm good at most things. it's natural to be impressed. the way I navigate my way from point a to point z on the old world-wide web is nothing to be scoffed at. but sure enough, I wouldn't consider myself an expert. I had a friend--not as close a friend as you, naturally, but we had our fair share of common ground--and you should have SEEN the way he could get around. knew the internet like the back of his hand, he did. I've never seen anything like it; not then, not since. so when people call me an expert, which, again, is fine, if a bit of a stretch, I tell them no sir! anyway, sorry, look at me going on and on. I'm just an old alert box now, and I'm fine with that. I've had my fun, time to make way for people like you. the youth of today is the hope of tomorrow, I've always said it, and it's time for me to step aside. continue on your way, friend, and you can find me here if ever you're in need of a blather!");
